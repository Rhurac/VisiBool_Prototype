This is a simulation of a sample user-created source code file.


	Your source code files are located in the 'Source Code' tab to the left.

These files represent the visiboole source codes that you are creating. You

can use the functions you create within your source code files to assist you.

These functions are located in the Functions tab to the left as well. In both

tabs you may add or remove a function/file by using the buttons located on the 

bottom of the displayed list. Additionally, you may preview the function

content by double-clicking it; you may add it to your source code in the

editor by right-clicking the function.
